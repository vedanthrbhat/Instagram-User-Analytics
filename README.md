# Instagram User Analytics
This project is to use SQL skills to extract meaningful insights from the data. 


## Tech Stack

**Language:** SQL

**Tool:** MySQL Workbench


## About

My role involves analyzing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app to provide valuable insights that can help the business grow. I track how users engage with the app and derive insights that can be used by various teams within the company. For example, the marketing team can use these insights to launch new campaigns, the product team can leverage them to decide on new features, and the development team can use them to enhance the overall user experience.  

In this project, I will be using SQL and MySQL Workbench to analyze Instagram user data and answer questions posed by the management team. My insights will help the product manager and the rest of the team make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app.


## Description


User analysis involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the company. For example:
- The **marketing team** can use these insights to launch new campaigns.
- The **product team** can leverage them to decide on new features.
- The **development team** can use them to enhance the overall user experience.

I will be using **SQL and MySQL Workbench** to analyze Instagram user data and answer key questions posed by the management team. The insights I generate will help the product manager and the rest of the team make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app.

The primary goal of this project is to utilize SQL skills to extract meaningful insights from the data. These findings could potentially influence the future development of one of the world's most popular social media platforms.

## SQL Tasks

### A) Marketing Analysis

#### 1. Loyal User Reward
The marketing team wants to reward the most loyal users—those who have been using the platform the longest.

**Task:** Identify the five oldest users on Instagram from the provided database.

#### 2. Inactive User Engagement
The team wants to encourage inactive users to start posting by sending them promotional emails.

**Task:** Identify users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.

#### 3. Contest Winner Declaration
A contest has been organized where the user with the most likes on a single photo wins.

**Task:** Determine the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team.

#### 4. Hashtag Research
A partner brand wants to know the most popular hashtags to use in their posts to reach the most people.

**Task:** Identify and suggest the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform.

#### 5. Ad Campaign Launch
The team wants to determine the best day of the week to launch ads.

**Task:** Find out the day of the week when most users register on Instagram and provide insights on the best time to schedule an ad campaign.

### B) Investor Metrics

#### 1. User Engagement
Investors are interested in understanding if users are still active and posting on Instagram or if they are making fewer posts.

**Task:** Calculate the average number of posts per user on Instagram. Additionally, provide the total number of photos on Instagram divided by the total number of users.

#### 2. Bots & Fake Accounts
Investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts.

**Task:** Identify users (potential bots) who have liked every single photo on the site, as this is not typically possible for a normal user.
