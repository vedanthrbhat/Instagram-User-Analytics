# Instagram-User-Analytics
 the goal of this project is to use your SQL skills to extract meaningful insights from the data. Your findings could potentially influence the future development of one of the world's most popular social media platforms.

My role involves analyzing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app to provide valuable insights that can help the business grow. I track how users engage with the app and derive insights that can be used by various teams within the company. For example, the marketing team can use these insights to launch new campaigns, the product team can leverage them to decide on new features, and the development team can use them to enhance the overall user experience.

In this project, I will be using SQL and MySQL Workbench to analyze Instagram user data and answer questions posed by the management team. My insights will help the product manager and the rest of the team make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app.
 
SQL Tasks :
A) Marketing Analysis:


Loyal User Reward: The marketing team wants to reward the most loyal users, i.e., those who have been using the platform for the longest time.
Your Task: Identify the five oldest users on Instagram from the provided database.
Inactive User Engagement: The team wants to encourage inactive users to start posting by sending them promotional emails.
Your Task: Identify users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.
Contest Winner Declaration: The team has organized a contest where the user with the most likes on a single photo wins.
Your Task: Determine the winner of the contest and provide their details to the team.
Hashtag Research: A partner brand wants to know the most popular hashtags to use in their posts to reach the most people.
Your Task: Identify and suggest the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform.
Ad Campaign Launch: The team wants to know the best day of the week to launch ads.
Your Task: Determine the day of the week when most users register on Instagram. Provide insights on when to schedule an ad campaign.
B) Investor Metrics:


User Engagement: Investors want to know if users are still active and posting on Instagram or if they are making fewer posts.
Your Task: Calculate the average number of posts per user on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram divided by the total number of users.
Bots & Fake Accounts: Investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts.
Your Task: Identify users (potential bots) who have liked every single photo on the site, as this is not typically possible for a normal user.

First Trainity project which helps implement and develop my skills in SQL using MySql Workbench to analyse Instagram Users data and provide various insights by completing the tasks given.
